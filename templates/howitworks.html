                Voters arrive at your branded voting website and authenticate their identity (how this works depends on the authentication method you selected in step 1). <br>
                If authentication was successful, the voter will be presented with a list of any ongoing event tab. If the voter hasn't yet voted, the voter may click on the ongoing events and a list of contestants will appear. <br>
                Then you just have to click on "Vote Me" button to whome you want to give vote. When the voter submits a vote, the results re seen only organizer publish it on public. The voter is now blocked from voting for the same event again.

                Once voting has ended the results are immediately tabulated which can only been seen by organizer. <br>
                Public can view the results only after the organizer publish it. <br>
                Once published, the results are made available to the public on your voting website and anyone will be able to verify the results by downloading a file containing vote counts.
