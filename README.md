This Online Voting System is a web-based application built using Django can serve as the automated voting system for organizations and/or institutions. 
The system works like the common election manual system of voting whereas the system must be populated by the list of the candidates, and events.
The Online voting system can help a certain event organization or school to minimize the voting time duration because aside providing the voters an online platform to vote, 
the system will automatically count the votes for each candidate. The system has 2 sides of the user interface which are the administrator and voters side. The admin user 
is in charge to populate and manage the data of the system and the voter side which is where the voters will choose their candidates and submit their votes.

## How the system works
Administrator is required to have created candidates. 
Before creating candidates, the admin must have create Events
After doing this, the voters can vote (provided that they are registered and verified)

## How do voters get verified ?
OTP is sent to voter's email address.

## Can OTP verification be bypassed ?
Yeah, sure.
Open `settings.py` and toggle `SEND_OTP` to  `False`
Then, wait till server restarts
